This is the Adaptive Linear element (Adaline) model which was proposed by Widrow heff in 1960.

This code generates output with respect to only one case at a time i.e., "(x1,x2)" are the inputs which produce a targeted output "t".

In this code if you want to assign your own weights then you can do it when the output window shows do you want to change weights.

You can cross verify you weights to check if the new weights are satisfying the whole functional bi-polar table.
